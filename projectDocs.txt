In this project we have used Multer: Its a very famous library which allows you to easily upload files from your
frontend ( any frontend - JS frontend , React frontend or any other)

We have created the images folder , to store all the images that will be uploaded


With Multer , we always have to make 3 things ,as it serves as a middleware

the middleware will be passed from Multer to app.post , where before showing the message "Image Uploaded" , the image
would have been uploaded.
